        <h1 align="center">A Brief History of Ray Tracing</h1>
        <h3 align="center">Basic premise of ray tracing:</h3>
        <p>Ray tracing is a technique that “shoots” rays from a specific 
            point/camera and follows them to see where the go and what 
             bounce off of. This is very effective technique to render 
             very realistic and immersive lighting and shading in movies, 
             pictures, and video game. The core idea of ray tracing has 
             been around for hundreds of years and the use of ray tracing 
             in video and images has been in use for decades. However, 
             it was not until recently that ray tracing as we know it 
             began to be used by companies like Pixar for their animated 
             films. It has been even more recently that the hardware 
             capabilities were finally good enough to run a “lighter” 
             version of ray tracing in real time in video games.</p>

        <h3 align="center">Durer’s Door and the inception of ray tracing:</h3>
        <p width="75%">Ray tracing is a concept that originated as far back as the 
            1525 when Albrecht Durer created an apparatus known as 
            Durer’s Door. Durer’s Door was a primitive setup that 
            consisted of a stylus, a string that connects to the stylus 
            and extends through a door and attaches to a hook mounted 
            to a wall. In this concept, the hook on the wall represents 
            the camera in modern ray tracing. Due to this invention and 
            the written works by Durer, he is credited with the 
            invention of ray tracing.</p>
        <h3 align="center">Ray tracing in the modern era:</h3>
        <p>After 1525, not a lot is known about the development of the 
            concept of ray tracing until it was first successfully used 
            to 1968 to create a computer-generated shaded image. This 
            image was created by Arthur Appel. 3 years later, a 3D 
            simulation was released by Mathematical Application Group 
            Inc. (MAGI). In this simulation, MAGI used ray tracing to, 
            in reverse order, simulate the photographic process.  The 
            technique they used, which was based on ray tracing, was 
            called ray casting. Using this technique, they cast rays 
            perpendicularly from each pixel on the screen. Any surface 
            that each ray would hit would be put together to form a 
            final shaded picture of the objects that were present. A 
            second example of ray casting was presented by Scott Roth 
            in 1976. After this point, there were many more instances 
            of individuals and companies creating and testing their 
            own forms of ray tracing. </p>
        <h3 align="center">Ray tracing in film:</h3>
        <p>The film industry was one of the first major industry to 
            adopt ray tracing as a widely used lighting technique in 
            animations. While this feels like a while ago, it wasn’t 
            until the last 10 years when the first movies began to 
            come out that fully utilized ray tracing for their lighting 
            and shading needs. One of the first movie that came out 
            that fully utilized ray tracing was the movie Monster’s 
            University which released in 2013. After this, almost 
            every Pixar movie and many other movie studios moved to 
            ray tracing due to it’s realistic and beautiful final 
            results. The ray tracing technique that is used by these 
            studios as well as all of the other post-processing that 
            needs to be done requires render farms of thousands of 
            computers to render each individual frame of the movie. 
            This process can still take a very long time. In the 
            case of Monster’s University, it took Pixar 29 hours to 
            render each frame of the movie. At 24 frames per second, 
            this adds up to an insane amount of time to render the 
            whole movie. Knowing this, it seems incredible that Nvidia 
            was able to create a technology that uses raytracing, while 
            not at the same level, and renders dozens if not hundreds 
            of frames per second. </p>
        <h3 align="center">Ray tracing in video games:</h3>
        <p>Much later, the video game industry was able to adopt ray 
            tracing as a phenomenal lighting and shading technique 
            for its games. While this technology had been around for 
            decades, there did not exist a powerful enough graphics 
            card that could render lighting on demand using ray 
            tracing. Ray tracing takes in insane amount of power and 
            speed to be able to render individual light particles 
            and to track where they go and what they bounce off of. 
            It was hard enough for many modern games to render 
            immersive lighting using the traditional, less intensive, 
            rasterization technique. This all changes when, in 2018, 
            the graphics card manufacturer Nvidia developed and 
            released their 2000 series graphics cards which contained 
            a new hardware technology called RT cores (Ray Tracing 
            Cores). These cores were specifically designed to know 
            how to render light particles. This was their only job 
            and the algorithms they used were developed for rendering 
            and track light particles. By making dedicated cores that 
            utilize he real time ray tracing algorithm, Nvidia was 
            able to offload some of the work of the traditional CUDA 
            cores. This was the most successful technique ever 
            developed for rendering immersive lighting in video games 
            and RT cores were pretty good at their job all things 
            considered. While the performance was still not at the 
            desired level, it was still the best it had ever been. 
            After Nvidia developed this technology, it was up to the 
            individual game studies to implement it into their video 
            games. Dice Studios, which is based out of Stockholm 
            Sweden partnered with Nvidia to showcase Nvidia’s ray 
            tracing technology alongside their own brand-new 
            Battlefield title, Battlefield V. Since then, many game 
            studios have implemented ray tracing as their primary 
            form of light rendering while also providing traditional 
            rasterization techniques so that consumers who do not 
            have the hardware capabilities to run ray tracing can 
            still play their games. Although, at the cost of not 
            benefiting from the graphical fidelity that ray tracing 
            provides. Being able to play using rasterization 
            techniques is still better than not being able to play 
            at all. Since the launch of the RTX 2000 series graphics 
            cards in 2018, Nvidia has release an entirely new 
            generation of graphs cards called the 3000 series cards. 
            These cards have gained significant performance in ray 
            tracing performance over the 2000 series graphics cards.</p>
